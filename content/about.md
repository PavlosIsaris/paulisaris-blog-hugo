<p style="text-align: center">Hi, my name is Paul and this is my professional blog!</p>

<img src="/img/paul_circle.png" alt="Paul Isaris picture">

I am a professional software engineer, passionate about **clean code** and **software craftsmanship**. I strongly believe in the power of the community worldwide and therefore, I love to share my knowledge and broaden my horizons.
I am particularly interested in **software design** and **Agile  practices**.
    
I have 6 years of software engineering experience in a plethora of projects ranging from **open-source assistive technologies** (like [video games for blind people](https://www.scify.gr/site/en/impact-areas-en/assistive-technologies/memorien)) and **commercial applications**, all the way to **startup consulting** and **product development**, acting also as a [Scrum Master](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-master).

During the last 3 years, I have also been working as a **teacher**, teaching programming and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) subjects to kids and teenagers, as well as to adults.

When not typing away at my keyboard, I enjoy playing the guitar, running, blogging, and reading books about philosophy, history, and software craftsmanship.

I am currently employed at [SciFY](http://www.scify.gr/site/en/), working as a full-stack software engineer.


Apart from designing and writing software, I also enjoy reading books, running, crossfitting, and playing the guitar.
