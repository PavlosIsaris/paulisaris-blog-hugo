Professional software engineer, passionate about clean code and software craftsmanship. I strongly believe in the power of the community worldwide and therefore, I love to share my knowledge and broaden my horizons. I am particularly interested in software design and Agile  practices.

I am currently employed at [SciFY](http://www.scify.gr/site/en/), working as a full-stack software engineer.

Since 2017, I have been teaching teenagers about programming, graphics and audio manipulation and Internet usage at [Actionaid Επίκεντρο](http://epikentro.actionaid.gr/).


Apart from designing and writing software, I also enjoy reading books, running, crossfitting, and playing the guitar.
